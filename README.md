# Ego Artificial Parking
A promising project of helping drivers to park the car. Via the hot technology of deep learning provides an optimal solution to avoid mutiple drivers drive for less parking slots, improving the efficiency of usage of parking places.

## Usage

1. Install all dependencies
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
2. Execute `python main.py` under folder 'app/'

3. Visit http://localhost:5000/


## Deep Learning Model
To run the AI model, please download pre-trained model file from https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5, then putting it under the folder 'app/static/', then jump back to the step *Usage* to run the server, now you are available to visit http://localhost:5000/getParkingSpots 

This part aims to have the real-time scenario of a parking spot, meanwhile, the data about the usage of the parking spot is stored. As a result, we are able to reccomend free parking places to drivers instantly, what's more, by analyzing the data in the past we can predict how likely a parking spot will be fully taken.
